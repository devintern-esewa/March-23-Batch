        // What is a method in Java?
        // A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of code grouped together to perform a
        // certain task or operation. It is used to achieve the reusability of code. We write a method once and use
        // it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It also provides the easy modification and
        // readability of code, just by adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only when we call
        // or invoke it.
        //
        // The most important method in Java is the main() method. If you want to read more about the main() method,
