    // Generally, the primitive number types are classified into two categories:
    //
    // Whole numbers: The whole numbers hold the complete number, positive and negative, for example, 170, 225, -170,
    // -225, etc. For these numbers, the valid data types are byte, short, int, and long. It depends on the number
    // that which data type would be preferred.
    //
    // Floating Numbers: The floating numbers are the numbers with a fraction part. These numbers have one or more
    // decimal values, for example, 10.25, 15.25, etc. For these numbers, the valid data types are float and double.
    //
    // From the all above data types, the int, double, and float are the most widely used data types.
