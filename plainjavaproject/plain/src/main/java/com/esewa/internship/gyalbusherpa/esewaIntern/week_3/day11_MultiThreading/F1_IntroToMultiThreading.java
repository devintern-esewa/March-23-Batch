        Multitasking
            - Executing several task simultaneously is the concept of multitasking. There are two types of multitasking,
                Process based and thread based.

            1) Process based is executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate independent process.
                Example. while typing a code in java ide, we can listen audio from the same system while downloading a
                file. All these task will be executed simultaneously and independent of each other. Hence, it is
                process
                based multitasking.
                It is the best suitable at OS level.

            2) Thread based is executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate independent part of
                the same program and each independent part is called a thread.
                It is the best suitable at programmatic level.


                the main objective of multitasking is to reduce response time of system and to improve performance.

        To develop web servers and application servers etc.
        When compared with old languages, developing multithreaded app in java is very easy because java provides
        inbuilt support for multithreading with rich api.
