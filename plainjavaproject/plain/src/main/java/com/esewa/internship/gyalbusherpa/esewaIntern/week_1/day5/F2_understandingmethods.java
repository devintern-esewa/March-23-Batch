        Method Declaration
        The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such as visibility, return-type, name, and
        arguments. It has six components that are known as method header, as we have shown in the following figure.

        Method Signature: Every method has a method signature. It is a part of the method declaration. It includes the method
        name and parameter list.

        Access Specifier: Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the
        method. Java provides four types of access specifier:

            Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier in our application.
            Private: When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
            Protected: When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in
            a different package.
            Default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by
            default. It is visible only from the same package only.

        Return Type: Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may have a primitive data type, object,
        collection, void, etc. If the method does not return anything, we use void keyword.

        Method Name: It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a method. It must be corresponding to the
        functionality of the method. Suppose, if we are creating a method for subtraction of two numbers, the method name
        must be subtraction(). A method is invoked by its name.

        Parameter List: It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It
        contains the data type and variable name. If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses blank.

        Method Body: It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the actions to be performed. It is enclosed
        within the pair of curly braces.
